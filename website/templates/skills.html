    <p> We understand that education today goes beyond academic success. It’s about equipping students with the skills and values they need to thrive in a changing world. While we maintain a strong focus on academics, we also recognize the growing importance of practical and vocational skills in today’s economy.
    That’s why we’ve embedded Catering and Home Management into our curriculum, giving our students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in preparing various Nigerian snacks and dishes. Through this program, students learn not only the art of cooking but also the discipline, creativity, and entrepreneurial skills that come with it.

            <p>Our young chefs mastered the secret to a good pot of Nigerian Jollof Rice and Fried Rice. The balance between spice, seasoning, and the smoky aroma that makes it special. This dish also taught them teamwork, as it involves several preparation steps from chopping to cooking.
                This colorful dish helped students practice vegetable cutting, frying, and combining ingredients properly. They learned how to cook rice to the right texture and mix it perfectly with vegetables, liver, and seasonings for that signature fried rice flavor.
